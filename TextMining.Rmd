## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Text Mining: Tokenization

- Variables are columns
- Observations are rows
- Each type of observational unit is a table

Tidytable is a table with one-token-per-row.

Token is usually a single word, sentence or paragraph that is a "meaningful
unit of text"

The key is to *keep* the words that matter!
